# learnAngular

-> A UI framework built by Google
-> A component-based framework for building scalable app
-> Provided collection of libraries to cover features like routing ,Forms

-> Angular is a development platform for building a single page application for mobile and desktop
-> It is used for building client side application using HTML,CSS and a programming language like JS,TS
-> Angular is not a programming lang in itself like JS

->> FRAMEWORK

-> A framework is like a platform for developing software application
-> A framework can have pre-defined classes and functions that can be reused to add several
functionalitires, which other wise we should have to write from scratch by our own

--> Advantages Of angular
 -> It gives our application a clean and loosely coupled structure that is easy to understand & maintain
 -> It brings a lot of utility code which can be reused in lot of application 

->> Single Page Application 

-> A single page application is a web application which has only one HTML page.
-> When we navigate around, only the content of that HTML page changes.
-> The page itself never changes.

--> Advantage of SPA

 -> Since we are using JS to change the content of the page ,it is much faster .
 -> Here we are not reaching out to the server to request a new piece of HTML data, every time we 
    navigate to a different URL
 -> This allows us to create an application which is fast and reactive

->> Component

 -> A component is a piece of user interface
 -> Every Angular application has at least one component
